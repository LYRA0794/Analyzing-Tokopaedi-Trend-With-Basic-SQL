Based on klausa_dasar_part1.sql allows us to learn into fundamental SQL concepts. We initiate our journey by comprehending the process of creating tables, knowing the SELECT statement and using the FROM clause. Furthermore, gaining insights into the wildcard '*' and its strategic role in database querying enhances our ability to craft targeted and effective SQL queries. So, here is an explanation of each clause used:

1. **Create Table:**
   In SQL, the `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to define and create a new table in a database. It includes specifying the table name and defining the columns along with their data types and constraints.

2. **Select:**
   The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, apply conditions using the `WHERE` clause and perform various operations on the data.

3. **From:**
   The `FROM` clause in SQL is used to specify the source table or tables from which you want to retrieve data. It is an essential part of the `SELECT` statement and indicates the tables involved in the query.

4. **Asterisk (*) - Wildcard:**   
   The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character in SQL that represents all columns of a table when used in the `SELECT` statement. It is a shortcut to select all available columns without explicitly listing each one.

Understanding these clauses not only empowers us to structure and retrieve data more effectively but also lays the foundation for optimized database management and enhanced query performance in future SQL endeavors.
